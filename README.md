# CNN-X-Ray-Classification
Final submission for MA3832, Neural Network and Deep Learning.
The main dataset includes x-ray images of the chest area and are classified into 3 categories, normal, pneumonia and covid. The purpose of this project was to create a CNN via AWS that can predict the correct label, done by using my own proposed model
and VGG19 via transfer learning.
